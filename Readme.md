## Installation
The server requires express, mysql2, sequelize and dotenv in order to run. Type "npm i" from the command line to install these packages and their dependencies.

 
## Usage
A ".env" file is required to be in the root directory of the application or environment parameters set if deploying in a cloud environment. The environment paramters required are "DB_NAME=<database-name>, DB_USER=<sql username>, DB_PW=<sql password>" where triangle brackets denote your own parameters. Note: your database name must match an existing database.
